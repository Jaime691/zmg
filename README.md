### Prototyping the voting box

When a start the project the first a though about was the functional components and which would manage the state of the application. I used the app Proto-React.

### Good components

Another key aspect of the app was to think about how to make the components reusable, simple and ease to read for another person.

###Â Don't reinvent the wheel
To make the state of the application persistent I used the library react-simple-storage, I was thinking about how to use the localStorage of the browser but found this approach and do it better than I could do.

### CSS-in-JS

To make more visible the interaction I used a little of CSS-in-JS in some components. I like to use it because if something fails is more ease to debug.
