# Layout

### How a would handle this part?

To deliver this part of the exercise I was going to use the framework Semantic-UI which has a fork that is integrated with ReactJS and avoids the use of jQuery.

I was going to rely on the framework's grid system for layout and responsiveness. For the "Voting boxes", I was going to use components library with a little theming to make them look like in the PSD.
